# PestDocs Bot

This bot let you ask questions answer based on the current Pest docs.

## Idea

The idea is to have a bot for the Pest docs, providing answers based on the current docs and not based on the old knowledge OpenAI has.

This is the code used for my tutorial on [How to use the OpenAI Assistants API in Laravel](http://gehri.dev/blog/how-to-use-the-openai-assistants-api-in-php-and-laravel)

## Installation

```bash
composer install
npm install
```

### .env
Then add your OpenAI Key to the .env file

## Usage

Follow the steps from the tutorial.

And don't forget to run `npm run dev`!
